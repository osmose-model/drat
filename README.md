## OSMOSE drat repository

This a CRAN style repository, so we can easily install development versions of several "private" packages (like 'osmose').

We also use it to install old versions of public packages that are compatible with the current version of R in DATARMOR. These are mostly the dependencies for the 'osmose' and 'calibrar' packages.
